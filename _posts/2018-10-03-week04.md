### [Assignment 6: Collaborative Editing Project](http://www.compsci.hunter.cuny.edu/~sweiss/course_materials/cs_ossd/assignments/assignment_06_team_project.pdf)

For these last four or so weeks, our Open Source Software development class has been keeping track of our experiences on learning about the wide and diverse world of free and open source software and services.

Our last assignment consisted of a simple exercise that had us practicing the intergration manager workflow, which is commonly used in software projects. Aside from forking someone else's repository, I was familiar with cloning, using git on my local machine, pushing local work to a remote repository and issuing pull requests.

This week's assignemnt had us reading the [ProGit chapter on Git Branching](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Branching-Branches-in-a-Nutshell) and then working on a collaborative project with team members.

While I had experience using git to branch and merge code, I wasn't aware of how exactly git is able to keep track of commits and branches. I was surprised that git uses pointers and pointer logic as the underlying mechanism for keeping track of changes. Having pointers keep track of snapshots of staged code means that the user can create branches in a fast and convienent manner.
