### [Assignment 7: Readings on Open Source, Part 2](http://www.compsci.hunter.cuny.edu/~sweiss/course_materials/cs_ossd/assignments/assignment_07_readings.pdf)

A perception I have, and in some ways continue to have, is that the world of open source software is intimidating. For some reason I have bought into the idea that the open source community consists solely of programming prodigies. Obviously this couldn't be further from the truth; on a rational level I understand that there are people from all walks of life with different skills, experiences, and weaknesses. I still find it difficult to not feel intimidated by how much I don't know and the sheer number of available projects.

I actually appreciate this weeks readings because they touch on many concerns I had when it comes to contributing to an open source project. They articles are:

* [A Beginner's Very Bumpy Journey Though the World of Open Source](https://medium.freecodecamp.org/a-beginners-very-bumpy-journey-through-the-world-of-open-source-4d108d540b39) by Shubheksha Jalan
* [How to Contribute to Open Source Without Coding](https://icontribute.wordpress.com/how-to-contribute-to-open-source-without-coding/) by Craig Buchek

* [GitHub's Guide to How to Contribute to Open Source](https://icontribute.wordpress.com/how-to-contribute-to-open-source-without-coding/)

I identified most with Shubheksha's article. Shubheksha was so intimidated, she tried for two years to contribute to a project. She focused on trivial fixes, such as typos, and didn't ask too many questions. I know exactly how this feels. I have occasional moments where I feel like I'm not a good enough programmer and sometimes feel embarrassed when asking questions.

What I found most valuable from her piece was her reaction when she got a cold response to her questions about a project. Instead of calling it quits, she made the astute observation that the problem wasn't with her, instead it was with that project community. She sought to contribute to [Mozilla](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/contribute/), which has a great reputation with new contributors. This seems like such a simple and obvious solution, but I think this will be very helpful to me. Instead of thinking the problem is that I ask questions, it's more likely that such an unwelcoming community isn't for me. Another piece of great advice is:

> Just Start. Don’t waste a lot of time choosing the “right” project. If you know a project or a organization with a beginner-friendly community, just start there.

Sometimes, the sheer number of possible projects to choose from could lead to indecisiveness. I think this is something I will keep in mind as I choose projects going forward.

The articles by Craig Buchek and the Github article have great resources when it comes to contributing. I particularly liked how Buchek's article also included other forms of contributing to projects that don't involve coding, from artistic contributions to political engagement. I like how the open source software movement has room for such diverse skills.

The sections from Karl Fogel's book *Producing Open Source Software, 2nd edition* on [Bug Trackers](https://producingoss.com/en/bug-tracker.html) and [Internet Relay Chat](https://producingoss.com/en/irc.html) are good introductions to the infrastructure supporting open source communities. One of the things that stood out to me was learning that the [Debian project](https://www.debian.org/intro/about) has over [800,000 bugs!](https://www.debian.org/Bugs/). The chapter goes on to state that this saturation of bug reports, which are mostly duplicates or invalid bug reports, is a common problem among popular open source projects. One of the solutions is to make sure every bug report filed is looked over by at least someone. The problem is that this requires many man-hours, and with the sheer volume of bug reports some projects face, it requires many volunteers to do this work. One of the solutions I thought was ingenious was to use a "buddy system". A user that wants to report a bug would get in contact using Internet Relay Chat or the project's mailing list until someone else confirms the bug, who would then report it. While creative, it's not perfect; it's not a guarantee that all users will follow this process any may submit a false bug anyway.
