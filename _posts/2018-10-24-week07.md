### [Assignment 9: A Bug Tracker Exercise]](http://www.compsci.hunter.cuny.edu/~sweiss/course_materials/cs_ossd/assignments/assignment_09_bug_trackers.pdf)

The assignment this week gave us a chance to familiarize ourselves with the Bugzilla issue tracking platform, specifically for [GNOME accessibility Bugs](https://bugzilla.gnome.org/buglist.cgi?quicksearch=GNOME%20Accessibility%20Bugs).

The assignment had us identify components of a submitted issue or bug, and learn how these components help projects organize the issues regarding the software. I admit that there were moments where I thought that hunting these definitions was tedious, but I understand that learning how issue trackers work is something that is necessary, so I think this was an appropriate exercise and introduction to issue trackers. The only problem that exacerbated the tedium was the the unorganized nature of the site. It took a while to navigate different pages on the site to find satisfactory definitions of the terms. 

Overall, I think this exercise was worth while. I have a good idea of what to expect when navigating an important infrastructure of open source projects.
