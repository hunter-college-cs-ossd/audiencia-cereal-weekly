### [Assignment 8: A Second Git Workflow Exercise](http://www.compsci.hunter.cuny.edu/~sweiss/course_materials/cs_ossd/assignments/assignment_08_git_workflow_2.pdf)

The assignment this week was designed to get us more comfortable with merge conflicts in our workflow, as it's a given we will be dealing with them in all collaborative environments. Prior to the assignment, I had some experience dealing with merge conflicts, but not from pull requests from remote repositories. Resolving merge conflicts wasn't too challenging, but the practice was good for reinforcing my skills in managing workflow. The only part of the exercise that threw me off was in implementing the method to print the string, as I wasn't familiar with function pointers and their use. I asked my teammates for help and they were more than willing to clear up any confusion I had on their use. This, however, wasn't that big of a deal. The code required on our part wasn't too complicated, and there's never any harm in learning something new.
