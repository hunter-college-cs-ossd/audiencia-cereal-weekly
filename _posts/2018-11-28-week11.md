# Assignment 12: Bug Triage and Fixing

The nature of open source means that potentially hundreds if not thousands of people can contribute to one project. It's not difficult to see that attempting to coordinate those volunteers might pose a challenge in determining the best way to allocate time and resources to problems.

A great solution is in the usage of bug trackers. These websites provide a standardized way of reporting and collaborating in issues, errors, and requests among the volunteers of software projects.

Triaging bugs, or categorizing bug reports according to their severity and priority, is an important skill that is well appreciated in any open source project community. Particularly important is making sure the submitted bug report contains as much useful information so as to help developers solve the issue.

This [article by Richard Schneeman](https://opensource.com/life/16/8/how-get-bugs-fixed-open-source-software) provides a great introduction into the thought process and mind set conducive to triaging bugs. This article is easy to read and he provides great explanations into all aspects of bug triage.

This article from [Teaching Open Source](https://quaid.fedorapeople.org/TOS/Practical_Open_Source_Software_Exploration/html/sn-Debugging_the_Code-Bug_Triage.html) does a quick summary of what bug triage teams do and why they're important in the development process. This article does a good job of explaining why it's important for developers to receive all possible relevant information in a bug report.

I also read these two wikis on triaging from [Bugzilla Triaging Guide](https://wiki.gnome.org/Bugsquad/TriageGuide) and [Ubuntu Bug Triage Advice](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Bugs/Triage) that provide detailed information in what is expected when triaging a bug report. Both should be read before beginning to triage bugs.

After reading and understanding what is expected, I looked into the bug reports on [https://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/](https://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/) to see if I could triage any newly reported and unassigned bugs. I decided to focus on software I at least had some familiarity with.

I searched all and sorted by *new*. I found one new report on problems relating to GNU GRUB. When attempting to install Ubuntu 18.04.1, the installation failed at the moment GRUB attempted to be installed.

https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/grub-installer/+bug/1806205

I decided to search using the name of the package, grub-installer, as the keyword to see if I could find any duplicate problems. I managed to find some and decided to mark them as duplicate. Before I did so, I made sure to leave a polite comment explaining its duplicate status.

https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/grub-installer/+bug/1806287

https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/grub-installer/+bug/1806259

https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/grub-installer/+bug/1806218

This was a straight forward assignment that will definitely be useful when evaluating bug reports for any open source project. What I find most impactful from this exercise is that I really need to use a good faith effort in determining how important the issue is or whether it's not important at all. I am expected to approach a report from every angle, such as determining if the issue is stale, if there's enough relevant information for a developer, if the issue isn't a bug but rather the reporter is having difficulty in using the software, and so on. These are skills that develop and get refined with practice.
