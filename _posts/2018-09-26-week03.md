# Git Workflow Assignment

The assignment for this week asked us to practice using git and *GitHub* to contribute to an already existing 
project. We were required to fork an existing repository, clone the fork locally, make the appropriate changes and commit them 
locally, then push the changes to our forked repository, and finally open a pull request.

I found this to be a fairly straight-forward process and didn't encounter much difficulty. I was already familiar with
using git and *GitHub* for class homework and my projects. This was the first time I forked an existing repository and I can see how
useful it is when contributing to a project with potentially dozens of contributors. This was a simple and unambiguous process
that gave me good practice with a structured and organized project. This will be very helpful when I begin contributing to an
existing open-source project.
