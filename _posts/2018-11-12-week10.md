# Assignment 11: Setting up a Development Environment for an Open Source Project

All of this semester, I've been learning about the basics of open source and the many important tools associated with such projects. I'm now at the point where I start to contribute to an existing project.
The project I chose to contribute to is [Cataclysm: Dark Days Ahead](https://cataclysmdda.org/), a text-based survival game available on Windows, macOS, and GNU/Linux.

As the project repository is hosted on GitHub, I need to make sure was familiar with appropriate work-flow for the project. To start, I read [GitHub Flow by Scott Chacon](http://scottchacon.com/2011/08/31/github-flow.html) and [GitHub Flow Instructions](https://help.github.com/articles/github-flow/) on the GitHub help website, in order to familiarize myself with a work-flow that is typically used on GitHub projects. I found the structure of the work-flow to be simple and logical, with the most important idea being that the *master* branch of repository should always be stable and deployable. Any work should be done on a branch off *master*, that could then be discussed and scrutinized by the wider community.

But before I set up the development environment, I made sure to read the [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/CleverRaven/Cataclysm-DDA/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md), to make sure I understood what was expected of me as I begin to interact with this community.

Now for the development environment, I read the [Contributing](https://github.com/CleverRaven/Cataclysm-DDA/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md) document which describes important standards when contributing to the project, such as opening new issues and preferred code style. This page also describes the process for setting up the development environment

### Steps I took for setting up the  development environment

1. On the repository site on GitHub, I made a fork of the project
 ![fork of the project](audiencia-cereal-weekly/images/fork_cataclysm)

2. I obtained the url for my fork and cloned it locally using:

    $ git clone https://github.com/audiencia-cereal/Cataclysm-DDA.git

    ![url of fork](audiencia-cereal-weekly/images/clone_cataclysm.png)

3. I then added the original repository as a remote, to make sure I could pull down the most recent version of the master branch

    $ git remote add -f upstream https://github.com/CleverRaven/Cataclysm-DDA.git

4. I made sure to carefully read the [compiling](https://github.com/audiencia-cereal/Cataclysm-DDA/blob/master/COMPILING.md) document for build information. I am using Ubuntu 18.04 as my development platform.

    * I checked to make sure my version of g++ supports the C++11 standard, as this is what the project will be using
    ![g++ version](audiencia-cereal-weekly/images/g++_standard.png)

    * I read the [dependencies section](https://github.com/audiencia-cereal/Cataclysm-DDA/blob/master/COMPILING.md#dependencies) to make a note of important and optional packages for my build.

    sudo apt-get install libncurses5-dev libncursesw5-dev build-essential

    * I looked at the [make flags section](https://github.com/audiencia-cereal/Cataclysm-DDA/blob/master/COMPILING.md#make-flags) to look for available options for compilation

    * Finally, I made my own build:

        $ make -j4

        ![cataclysm](audiencia-cereal-weekly/images/cataclysm.png)

Setting up the development environment for my first open source project contribution was straight forward; I didn't encounter any problems with compilation and dependency issues. I take this as proof that all the assignments this past semester enabled me to set up the development environment competently.
